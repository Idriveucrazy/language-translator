HOW TO ARRANGE THESE FILES IN VS CODE:

to run this application you need to make a root folder lets say babel-fish
files-app.py,requirements.txt,README.md will be in root directory
files-index.html,result.html should be in stored inside "templates" folder which will be inside root folder(babel-fish)
files-styles.css should be inside "static" folder which will be inside root folder(babel-fish)

make sure you make all these folders such that structure should be:


babel-fish/
│
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── venv/
├── templates/
│   └── index.html
├── static/  (optional if you add CSS later)

 arrange your files in this structure then carry out the steps to run the application.
